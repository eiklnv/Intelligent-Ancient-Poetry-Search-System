# Ancient Poetry Intelligent Search System

## Overview

The intelligent search system for ancient poetry plays a significant role in cultural heritage preservation and enhancing research efficiency. Currently, traditional methods involve search engines, specialized ancient poetry websites, and direct queries to large language models. However, these methods have notable deficiencies in understanding search intent, authority, and completeness.

This project addresses these issues by leveraging large language model (LLM) technology to build an intelligent search system for ancient poetry. The key contributions of this work include:

Dataset Creation: Compiled and released a dataset of 220,000 ancient poetry pieces, including structured information on people and place names.
Two-Stage Search System: Designed and implemented a two-stage search method using LLMs. The database construction phase utilizes LLMs to extract structured semantic information, while the search phase converts search intents into database retrieval commands.
Prompt Engineering: Developed a method for structured information extraction using chain-of-thought and external knowledge-assisted prompts, and for converting natural language queries into database queries, which enhances the extraction of structured information from ancient poetry and improves understanding of user intents.
The prototype of the ancient poetry intelligent search system was implemented and tested with typical samples, achieving an accuracy of 75%. This demonstrates that our approach, by integrating the capabilities of large language models, effectively retrieves multi-dimensional structured semantic information from ancient poetry and understands user search intents with good performance.



## Features
